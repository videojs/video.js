The orange open movie project presents

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:12.000
Introductory titles are showing on the background of a water pool with fishes swimming and mechanical objects lying on a stone floor.

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.800
elephants dream

4
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.206
Two people stand on a small bridge.

5
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:40.000
The old man, Proog, shoves the younger and less experienced Emo on the ground to save him from being mowed down by a barrage of jack plugs that whir back and forth between the two massive switch-board-like walls.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The plugs are oblivious of the two, endlessly channeling streams of bizarre sounds and data.

7
00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:51.994
Emo sits on the bridge and checks his limbs.

8
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.030
After the squealing plugs move on, Proog makes sure that Emo is unharmed and urges him onwards through a crack in one of the plug-walls.

9
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.000
They walk through the narrow hall into a massive room that fades away into blackness on all sides.

10
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:34.200
Only one path is visible, suspended in mid-air that runs between thousands of dangling electric cables on which sit crowds of robin-like robotic birds.

11
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
As Proog and Emo enter the room, the birds begin to wake up and notice them.

12
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Realizing the danger, Proog grabs Emo by the arm.

13
00:01:50.050 --> 00:02:00.000
They run along the increasingly bizarre path as the birds begin to swarm.

14
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:11.000
All sound is blocked out by the birds which are making the same noises as the jack-plugs, garbled screaming and obscure sentences and static.

15
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.000
The path dead-ends, stopping in the middle of no-where above the infinite drop.

16
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.000
Proog turns around as the birds reach them and begin to dive-bomb at them.

17
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.000
At the last moment, Proog takes out an old candlestick phone and the birds dive into the speaker piece.

18
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.000
The screen cuts to black.

19
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.000
In the next scene, Proog stands at one end of a room, suspiciously watching what is probably the same candlestick phone, which is ringing.

20
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.000
Emo watches from the other side of the room.

21
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.000
The phone continues to ring.

22
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.000
After a while Emo approaches it to answer it, but Proog slaps his hand away.

23
00:02:57.972 --> 00:02:59.100
Proog takes the ear-piece off the hook.

24
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.054
The phone speaker revealed a mass of clawed, fleshy polyps which scream and gibber obscenely.

25
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000
There is a solemn silence as Emo looks around the room and the technical objects therein.

26
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Emo laughs disbelievingly and Proog walks away.

27
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In the next scene, the two enter another massive black room.

28
00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:04.000
There is no path, the entry platform is the only structure that seems to be there except for another exit, lit distantly at the far side.

29
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:14.000
Proog takes a step forward into the void, and his feet are suddenly caught by giant typewriter arms that rocket up out of the blackness to catch his feet as he dances across mid-air.

30
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.000
Emo follows Proog with somewhat less enthusiasm as the older man leads the way.

31
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
They reach the end of the room and go through a hall into a small compartment.

32
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Proog presses a button, and the door shuts.

33
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.000
It is an elevator.

34
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:24.000
The elevator lurches suddenly as it is grabbed by a giant mechanical arm and thrown upwards, rushing up through an ever-widening tunnel.

35
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.000
When it begins to slow down, another arm grabs the capsule and throws it even further up.

36
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:40.000
As it moves up, the walls unlock and fall away, leaving only the floor with the two on it, rushing higher and higher.

37
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.000
They exit the tunnel into a black sky and the platform reaches the peak of its arc.

38
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.000
The elevator begins to drop down another shaft, coming to rest as it slams into the floor of another room and bringing the two to a level stop.

39
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.000
A camera flashes.

40
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:34.000
They are in a large, dingy room filled with strange, generator-like devices and dotted with boxy holographic projectors.

41
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.000
One of them is projecting a portion of wall with a door in it right beside them.

42
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.000
The door seems harmless enough.

43
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.100
From behind the door comes light music.

44
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.100
Proog presses a button on his cane, which changes the holograph to another wall.

45
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:11.000
Proog finishes the wall, and boxes them into a Safe Room, out of the view of anything outside.

46
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.500
Proog slaps him, trying to bring him to his senses.

47
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Emo storms away down the length of the room towards a wall he apparently cannot see and the wall begins to move, extending the length of the room.

48
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.000
The walls begin to discolour and mechanical roots start tearing through the walls to his left.

49
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.000
The roots move forwards toward Proog.

50
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The rest of the safety wall crumples away as a pair of massive hands heave out of the ground and begin to attack.

51
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:37.000
Proog is knocked down by the shockwave, while Emo turns and begins to walk away, waving his finger around his temple in the 'crazy' sign.

52
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:44.000
In a last effort, Proog extricates himself from the tentacle roots, and cracks Emo over the back of the head with his cane.

53
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:51.000
As Emo collapses, everything falls away, and Proog and Emo are left in one tiny patch of light in the middle of blackness.

54
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:20.000
The scene fades to black while panning over a pile of tentacle roots lying on the ground.

55
