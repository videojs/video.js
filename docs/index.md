# [Video.js][vjs] Documentation

There are two categories of docs: [Guides][guides] and [API docs][guides-api].

Guides explain general topics and use cases (e.g. setup). API docs are automatically generated from the codebase and give specific details about functions, properties, and events.

## Guides

### Getting Started

#### [Setup][guides-setup]

The setup documentation gives a deeper view of the additional methods you can use to trigger the player setup.

#### [Options][guides-options]

There are a number of options that can be used to change how the player behaves, starting with the HTML5 media options like autoplay and preload, and expanding to Video.js specific options.

#### [Tracks][guides-tracks]

Tracks are used for displaying text information over a video, selecting different audio tracks for a video, or selecting different video tracks.

### Customizing

#### [API][guides-api]

The Video.js API allows you to control the video through javascript or trigger event listeners, whether the video is playing through HTML5, flash, or another playback technology.

#### [Skins][guides-skins]

You can change the look of the player across playback technologies just by editing a CSS file. The skins documentation gives you a intro to how the HTML and CSS of the default skin is put together.

#### [Tech][guides-tech]

A "tech" is the shorthand we're using to describe any video playback technology - be it HTML5 video, Flash, . Basically anything that has a unique API to audio or video. Additional playback technologies can be added relatively easily.

#### [Plugins][guides-plugins]

You can package up interesting Video.js customizations and reuse them elsewhere. Find out how to build your own plugin or use one created by someone else.

### Resources

#### [Glossary][guides-glossary]

Some helpful definitions for those unfamiliar with web video-related terms - with links to more technical details.

## API Docs

You can refer to the [full list of API docs][api], but the most relevant API doc is for the [Player][api-player].
