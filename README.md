## [Quick Start][getting-started]

Thanks to the awesome folks over at [Fastly][fastly], there's a free, CDN hosted version of Video.js that anyone can use. Add these tags to your document's `<head>`:

```html
<link href="//vjs.zencdn.net/8.21.1/video-js.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="//vjs.zencdn.net/8.21.1/video.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can include Video.js by getting it from [npm](https://videojs.com/getting-started/#install-via-npm), downloading it from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/releases) or by including it via [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) or another JavaScript CDN, like CDNjs.

```html
<!-- unpkg : use the latest version of Video.js -->
<link href="https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video-js.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/video.js/dist/video.min.js"></script>

<!-- unpkg : use a specific version of Video.js (change the version numbers as necessary) -->
<link href="https://unpkg.com/video.js@8.21.1/dist/video-js.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/video.js@8.21.1/dist/video.min.js"></script>

<!-- cdnjs : use a specific version of Video.js (change the version numbers as necessary) -->
<link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/video.js/8.21.1/video-js.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/video.js/8.21.1/video.min.js"></script>
```

Next, using Video.js is as simple as creating a `<video>` element, but with an additional `data-setup` attribute. At a minimum, this attribute must have a value of `'{}'`, but it can include any Video.js [options][options] - just make sure it contains valid JSON!

```html
<video
    id="my-player"
    class="video-js"
    controls
    preload="auto"
    poster="//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.png"
    data-setup='{}'>
  <source src="//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.mp4" type="video/mp4"></source>
  <source src="//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.webm" type="video/webm"></source>
  <source src="//vjs.zencdn.net/v/oceans.ogv" type="video/ogg"></source>
  <p class="vjs-no-js">
    To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a
    web browser that
    <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">
      supports HTML5 video
    </a>
  </p>
</video>
```

When the page loads, Video.js will find this element and automatically setup a player in its place.

If you don't want to use automatic setup, you can leave off the `data-setup` attribute and initialize a `<video>` element manually using the `videojs` function:

```js
var player = videojs('my-player');
```

The `videojs` function also accepts an `options` object and a callback to be invoked when the player is ready:

```js
var options = {};

var player = videojs('my-player', options, function onPlayerReady() {
  videojs.log('Your player is ready!');

  // In this context, `this` is the player that was created by Video.js.
  this.play();

  // How about an event listener?
  this.on('ended', function() {
    videojs.log('Awww...over so soon?!');
  });
});
```
